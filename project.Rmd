STEP 1

Simulate data
- fix n 
- Xi from a jointly Uniform distribution
- Noise from a normal distribution (mean = 0, variance = very small)
- Yi linear combination of the Xi's + noise (with fixed Betas)

STEP 2

- Fit a linear regression model
- Get Beta estimators 

Check Lab 10 simulation

REPEAT Step 1 and Step 2 100 times
Get expected value of the Beta estimators. 
Get Sample Variance of the Beta estimators. 
Get MSE (check for consistency)

Repeat again with larger p
Do this until you reach a problem
